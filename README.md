Project Reflection

Designing Software

When approaching software design, I start by identifying the problem I want to solve and then break it down into smaller, manageable components. I consider how these components will interact and what data each part needs to function effectively. During this project, I developed new skills in structuring modular code, such as separating the logic for bricks, the paddle, and the ball. I learned to think not only about functionality but also about flexibility, maintainability, and readability. Following a design process—starting with planning, sketching out interactions, and then iterating—helped me create a system that is easy to extend, such as adding new types of bricks or modifying ball behavior. These tactics will be valuable in future projects, allowing me to approach new software challenges methodically while keeping scalability in mind.

Developing Programs

My approach to development involves iterative testing, building features step by step, and frequently validating that each part works correctly before moving on. This project strengthened my ability to debug visual and interactive elements in real-time, such as ensuring the ball’s collisions behaved as expected and that bricks responded correctly. I used new development strategies like randomizing attributes for dynamic visual feedback, and I learned the importance of separating drawing logic from movement and collision logic for clarity. Iteration played a central role: I tested collisions, adjusted velocities, and refined visual feedback multiple times, which ensured the final program behaved smoothly and responsively. Over the course of the milestones, my approach evolved from focusing solely on functionality to integrating usability and visual feedback into the development process.

Relevance to Goals and Future Pathways

Computer science equips me with problem-solving skills and logical reasoning that can be applied in a wide range of professional and academic pursuits. Working with computational graphics and visualizations has expanded my technical skills, especially in areas like OpenGL programming, geometry, and physics simulations. These experiences give me practical knowledge I can apply in future projects, such as creating interactive simulations, educational tools, or visualizations for data analysis. Professionally, these skills translate into the ability to design visually intuitive applications, optimize performance in graphics-intensive software, and implement engaging user experiences. This project has solidified my confidence in designing and developing software that is both functional and visually compelling, which will be invaluable as I continue my education and career in computer science.
